# Problem Statement
With the advent of generative AI, it has become easily difficult to separate real data from AI-Generated.
The goal is to develop a model that can identify a fake photo created by AI.

# Motivation
With the rise of generative AI, fake identities can be easily created using sophisticated algorithms. This has led to an increase in identity fraud, as fake identities can be used to gain access to online services and commit fraudulent activities. Thus, the purpose is to contribute to the development of more secure and reliable online services for everyone.

# Solution
Implement a predictive model that embibes the knowledge of AI-Generated images, and uses them to predict the label of a random image at test time.
